            <p className="text-lg mt-4 tracking-tight text-neutral-300">Trees are vital. As the biggest plants on the planet, they give us oxygen, store carbon, stabilise the soil and give life to the world’s wildlife. They also provide us with the materials for tools and shelter.</p>
            <p className="text-lg mt-4 tracking-tight text-neutral-300">Not only are trees essential for life, but as the longest living species on earth, they give us a link between the past, present and future. It’s critical that woodlands, rainforests and trees in urban settings, such as parks, are preserved and sustainably managed across the world.</p>
            <p className="text-lg mt-4 tracking-tight text-neutral-300">Play your part in helping to save the planet by planting trees or donating today.</p>
